## Key Configuration Changes

### Django Settings
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SSL requirement
- **Static Files**: WhiteNoise for efficient serving
- **Security**: HTTPS redirect, secure cookies, HSTS headers
- **Logging**: Container-friendly console logging
- **Environment**: Railway-specific variable handling

### Railway Integration
- **Build**: Dockerfile-based deployment
- **Environment**: Dynamic configuration from Railway variables
- **Health Checks**: Railway-compatible monitoring endpoints
- **Port Binding**: Dynamic port assignment via `$PORT` variable

### Security Enhancements
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data externalized
- **HTTPS**: Enforced in production
- **Headers**: Security headers for production
- **Cookies**: Secure session and CSRF cookies

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Dockerfile (Recommended)
- Uses the existing Dockerfile
- Builds container image on Railway
- Most reliable and consistent

### Option 2: Procfile
- Direct Python deployment
- Faster builds
- Less control over environment

### Option 3: Custom Script
- Uses `railway-start.sh`
- Maximum flexibility
- Requires careful environment management

## Environment Variables Required

### Core Django
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key
DEBUG=False
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=wepool_project.settings_railway
ALLOWED_HOSTS=.railway.app,your-app-name.railway.app
```

### Database
```bash
DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
DB_NAME=railway
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
DB_HOST=your-db-host.railway.app
DB_PORT=5432
```

### Security
```bash
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.railway.app
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True
```

### Email
```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@wepooltribe.com
```

## Health Check Endpoints

### Standard Health Check
- **URL**: `/core/health/`
- **Purpose**: General application health monitoring
- **Response**: Basic status and database connectivity

### Railway Health Check
- **URL**: `/core/railway-health/`
- **Purpose**: Railway-specific monitoring
- **Response**: Extended information including Railway environment details

## Testing and Validation

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test Railway settings
python manage.py check --settings=wepool_project.settings_railway

# Test static file collection
python manage.py collectstatic --settings=wepool_project.settings_railway

# Test with Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.railway.yml up
```

### Railway Testing
```bash
# Deploy to Railway
./deploy-railway.sh

# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs

# Test health endpoints
curl https://your-app.railway.app/core/railway-health/
```
