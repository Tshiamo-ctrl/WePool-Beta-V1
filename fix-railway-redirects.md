# Fix Railway Redirect Loop Issue

## üö® Problem
You're experiencing a redirect loop error: `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` on your Railway deployment.

## üîç Root Cause
The issue is caused by Django trying to enforce HTTPS redirects while Railway already handles HTTPS at the proxy level. This creates an infinite redirect loop.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied
I've updated the Railway settings to:
1. Disable `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` (prevents redirect loops)
2. Set secure cookies to `False` initially
3. Trust Railway's proxy headers properly

## üöÄ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. **Update Railway Environment Variables**
In your Railway dashboard, set these environment variables:

```bash
# Security (Fix for redirect loops)
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=False
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=False

# Railway Configuration
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=wepool_project.settings_railway
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### 2. **Redeploy the Application**
After updating environment variables:
```bash
# If using Railway CLI
railway up

# Or trigger a new deployment from Railway dashboard
```

### 3. **Verify the Fix**
- Clear your browser cookies for the Railway domain
- Visit your Railway URL again
- Should see the landing page without redirect loops

## üîß What Was Changed

### Before (Causing Redirect Loop):
```python
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = False  # Let Railway handle HTTPS
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False  # Will be True when HTTPS confirmed
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False     # Will be True when HTTPS confirmed
```

## üìã Complete Environment Variables for Railway

```bash
# Django Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key
DEBUG=False
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=wepool_project.settings_railway
ALLOWED_HOSTS=.railway.app,your-app-name.railway.app

# Database
DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
DB_NAME=railway
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
DB_HOST=your-db-host.railway.app
DB_PORT=5432

# Security (Fixed)
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.railway.app
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=False
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=False

# Railway
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## üö® If Issues Persist

1. **Check Railway Logs**:
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all variables are set correctly
   - Check for typos in variable names

3. **Force Redeploy**:
   - Make a small change to trigger redeployment
   - Or use `railway up` command

## ‚úÖ Expected Result

After applying these fixes:
- ‚úÖ No more redirect loops
- ‚úÖ Landing page loads correctly
- ‚úÖ Login/registration works
- ‚úÖ All UI improvements visible
- ‚úÖ Water animations working

## üîÑ Alternative Solution

If you still have issues, you can temporarily use the development settings:
```bash
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=wepool_project.settings
DEBUG=True
```

Then gradually migrate to Railway settings once the redirect issue is resolved.

**Note**: The changes have been committed and pushed to the main branch. Railway should automatically redeploy with the fixes, but you may need to update the environment variables manually in the Railway dashboard.
