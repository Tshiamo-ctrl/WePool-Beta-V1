# Fix Railway PORT Environment Variable Issue

## 🚨 Problem Identified
Your Railway deployment is failing with the error:
```
Error: '$PORT' is not a valid port number.
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The application is trying to use the `$PORT` environment variable, but it's not being set by Railway, causing the port binding to fail.

## ✅ Solution Applied
I've updated all the deployment files to handle the PORT variable properly:

### 1. **Dockerfile Fixed**
- Now uses `${PORT:-8000}` syntax (PORT if set, fallback to 8000)
- Health check also uses dynamic port

### 2. **Procfile Fixed**
- Updated to use `${PORT:-8000}` instead of `$PORT`

### 3. **Railway Startup Script Fixed**
- Added fallback port handling

## 🚀 Immediate Actions Required

### **Step 1: Railway Should Auto-Redeploy**
After the fixes are pushed, Railway should automatically redeploy with the corrected configuration.

### **Step 2: Verify PORT Variable (Optional)**
In your Railway dashboard, you can optionally set:
```bash
PORT=8000
```
But this is not required - the app will use the fallback port.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Before (Causing Error):**
```dockerfile
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "--workers", "3", "--timeout", "120", "wepool_project.wsgi:application"]
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```dockerfile
CMD gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-8000} --workers 3 --timeout 120 wepool_project.wsgi:application
```

## 📋 Expected Results

After the fix:
- ✅ **Application should start** without PORT errors
- ✅ **Container should bind** to the correct port
- ✅ **Health checks should work**
- ✅ **App should be accessible** via Railway URL

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

### **Check Railway Logs**
Look for new error messages after the PORT fix.

### **Verify Deployment**
Ensure Railway has redeployed with the latest changes.

### **Test Health Check**
The health check should now work with the dynamic port.

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Port Binding Strategy**
- **Railway**: Uses `$PORT` environment variable
- **Local Development**: Falls back to port 8000
- **Docker**: Handles both scenarios gracefully

### **Environment Variable Fallback**
```bash
${PORT:-8000}
```
- If `$PORT` is set, use that value
- If `$PORT` is not set, use 8000 as default

## 📚 Related Files Updated

1. **`Dockerfile`** - Main container configuration
2. **`Procfile`** - Railway Procfile deployment
3. **`railway-start.sh`** - Custom startup script
4. **Health checks** - Now use dynamic ports

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Wait for Railway redeployment** (should be automatic)
2. **Check logs** for successful startup
3. **Test the application** - should now be accessible
4. **Verify landing page** loads correctly

## ✅ Success Indicators

- ✅ No more PORT errors in logs
- ✅ Container starts successfully
- ✅ Health check passes
- ✅ Application responds to requests
- ✅ Landing page loads

**Note**: The PORT fix has been committed and pushed. Railway should automatically redeploy with the corrected configuration. The app will now handle both Railway's dynamic port assignment and local development fallback ports.
